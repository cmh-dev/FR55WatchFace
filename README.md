# FR55WatchFace

A simple watchface for the Garmin FR55.

### Watch face installation

The watch face can be side loaded onto your Garmin FR55 by downloading the compiled execuatable from the [releases](https://github.com/cmh-dev/FR55WatchFace/releases) which should be copied to the `GARMIN/APPS` directory on your device.
